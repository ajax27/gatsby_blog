This is my third post using **Gatsby**. After about 12 hours trying to find a bug I have finally got back on track writing my blog. This does look like it will be the easiest way to get it online quickly.

This second paragraph is to see how it all looks laid out on the page, with any luck the display will look good and I will able to get this online with a bit more speed than previous attempts!
